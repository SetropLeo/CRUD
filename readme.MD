# [NODE-EXPRESS-CRUD] SQL Database Project

<pre>
My biggest motivation to study these technologies was to be able to create an application that could run not only in FrontEnd but also on the BackEnd.
I'm currently developing a food order application (Point of Sale) and i needed to save the data somewhere, so i decided to study the technologies below to learn more and be able to make the POS run 100%.
