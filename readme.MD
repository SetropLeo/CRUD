# [NODE-EXPRESS-CRUD] SQL Database Project

My biggest motivation to study these technologies was to be able to create an application that could run not only in FrontEnd but also on the BackEnd. 
I'm currently developing a food order application (Point of Sale) and i needed to save the data somewhere, so i decided to study the technologies below to learn more and be able to make the POS run 100%.

This project was made using:
- SQL Database Postgresand
- Node
- Express
